About.aspx, Contact.aspx, and Default.aspx are the default pages created.

PROJECT PLANNING:
*** What functionality can we realistically add? ***
How do we 'alert' the user? Email, text, mobile app reminders? All of the above?
What is the 'criteria' for what counts as a modification? 
	Check every character?
	Check using a sort of "bit sum" to see if overall value changes?
Let user check for updates that contain a specific phrase?
Check if a specific picture has been updated? (probably not).
Let user decide how often they'd like ping a website to check for updates.
