# CEN4020_GroupProject
Web application that alerts user whenever a given website is updated.

PROJECT PLANNING:

*** What language(s) should we use? ***
I think C++ or Python would be good choices being languages most of us are familiar with.
However, C# also seems like a great language that is geared towards web app development.  
Im currently in a C# class with Professor Mills. So if any of us had issues, it would be extremely easy to receive help.

*** What functionality can we realistically add? ***
How do we 'alert' the user? Email, text, mobile app reminders? All of the above?
What is the 'criteria' for what counts as a modification? 
	Check every character?
	Check using a sort of "bit sum" to see if overall value changes?
Let user check for updates that contain a specific phrase?
Check if a specific picture has been updated? (probably not).
Let user decide how often they'd like ping a website to check for updates.
