*** Make Log In Page the main entry point (If logged in, allow access to Main Page.
	Else, force user to log in. [Should NOT be able to paste URL as workaround]).

*** Decide on databases and hosting, use Microsoft SQL hosted using MS Azure?

*** [Mid Priority?] IIS Express is a VIRTUAL developer only mode, we will need
 to install "IIS Local" at some point... Click on individual PROJECT (not
solution), go to properties. Go to Web, and look at Servers.
